Air Quality Prediction:
This project focuses on predicting Air Quality using machine learning techniques. The dataset contains various atmospheric and pollutant parameters such as CO, SOâ‚‚, Ozone, Temperature, Humidity, etc. The goal is to build a predictive model and analyze factors affecting air quality.

ðŸ“Š Dataset Description
The dataset includes multiple air quality and meteorological parameters:
NHâ‚ƒ (Ammonia)
SOâ‚‚ (Sulphur Dioxide)
CO (Carbon Monoxide)
Ozone (Oâ‚ƒ)
Benzene, Toluene, Xylene
Temperature (Â°C)
Humidity (%)
Wind Speed (m/s)
Solar Radiation (W/mÂ²)
Rainfall (mm)
Atmospheric Pressure (mmHg)
These features were used to train a predictive model for air quality analysis.
